# Mario Brousse
### Description
*Mario Brousse* is a student project inspired by the gameplay of Nintendo’s famous *Mario Bros* game, but deeply rooted in the culture of [New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia). Coded in JavaScript using the Phaser library, this project recreates a platform level where the main character, **Néness** a Caldoche (a New Caledonian character of European descent), navigates through a landscape inspired by the local environment, filled with animals native to New Caledonia as enemies. The player’s goal is to reach a [traditional Kanak hut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kanak_house-2.jpg) called a "case" at the end of the level, which completes the game and displays their score. The game interface is presented through an HTML and CSS web page.

### Demo URL

## Main Features
- **Single Level**: The game includes one level where the player must reach the "case" to complete the level, ending the game and displaying the player’s final score.
- **Star Collection**: Stars appear randomly on the map and can be collected to increase the player’s score.
- **Block Breaking**: Golden blocks are hidden on the map, and the player can break them to earn extra points.
- **Enemy Elimination**: By jumping on enemies (pigs and deer), the player can eliminate them and earn points.
- **Score Display**: At the end of the game, the player’s total score is displayed.
